The scripts in this repo each launch a Tkinter GUI for the user to input values and calculate a quantity relating to exoplanet studies.

exo_unit_convert.py - Converts distance, time and mass units

hill_calc.py - Calculates quantities related to the Hill Radius

HZ_calc.py - Calculates the habitable zone boundaries around a single star (according to boundaries set by Kopparapu et al 2013)

kep_calc.py - Calculates quantities related to Keplerian velocities and periods

phot_calc.py - Converts photon wavelength/frequency/energy into other units

calc_binary_planet_stability_limits.py - Given the configuration of a binary star system (P or S type), this calculates the minimum semimajor axis a planet can occupy while maintaining a stable orbit
