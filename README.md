# Exoplanet Calculators

This repository contains a set of useful calculators for those topics relative to exoplanets.  The Python scripts in this repo each launch a Tkinter GUI for the user to input values and calculate a quantity.  I've been using these as an aid to my day-to-day research - I hope that others find them as useful as I have

 1. `exo_unit_convert.py` - Converts distance, time and mass units

 2. `hill_calc.py` - Calculates quantities related to the Hill Radius

 3. `HZ_calc.py` - Calculates the habitable zone boundaries around a single star (according to boundaries set by Kopparapu et al 2013)

 4. `kep_calc.py` - Calculates quantities related to Keplerian orbits (velocities and periods)

 5. `phot_calc.py` - Converts photon wavelength/frequency/energy into other units

 6. `calc_binary_planet_stability_limits.py` - Given the configuration of a binary star system (P or S type), this calculates the minimum semimajor axis a planet can occupy while maintaining a stable orbit

 7. `tidal_heating_calculator.py` - Given a primary and secondary body, calculates tidal heating on the secondary body

 8. `tidal_heating_plotter.py` - Plots the above calculation for a variety of secondary orbits
